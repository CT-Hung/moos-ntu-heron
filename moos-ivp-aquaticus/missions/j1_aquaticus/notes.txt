Tag manager optional config:

Tag cooling period applies to N vehcles trying to tag 1 vehicle

Tag cooling period gets longer and longer with each tag per vehicle

Tag cooling is different depending on whether the tagged vehicle
has the flag or not:

  1. Tag cooling period is shorter if tagging a vehicle with a flag
  2. Cooling period does not increase, or increases less, if the
     tagged vehicle as the flag

Vehicle's have different capabilities before long.
Defensive stalemates end up 


5 points for getting flag all the way back
1 point for getting the flag

* once the vehicle with the flag is back on the home side,
there is essentially nothing to stop it.

o A vehicle WITH A FLAG ON ITS HOMESide, cannot apply a tag
to a vehicle without a flag. Can apply a tag to a vehicle
with a flag


Have we settled on a competition configuration for FlagManager
and TagManager? Have we guaranteed competitors that this configuration
will not change?

Also, what is the shorebroker configuration for sharing variables
out to vehicles? Can we assume that all variables posted by Flag
Manager and Tag Manager of the form FOOBAR_VNAME will be shared out
to the right vehicle?


Anti-Hacking measures

  o Vehicle could change group name if they hacked pNodeReporter to
    change to the other group for a brief period

Is there a way to have any app provide a unique hash or fingerprint
to ensure that the app that is running has not been modified by a
bad actor?

App produces a hash based on the compilation process. Validator
creates a


Cyberhacks are DISALLOWED but largely unchecked. Can we have a
discussion at AUS to discuss possible hacks and whether to (a) add
countermeasurs (b) forbid and rely on compliance, (c) or leave
open and let a hacker be rewarded.


Intercept behavior:

cut range
when in tag range, post single tag request
optionally delay the tag until enemy has the flag? or close to the flag?

After vehicle has been tagged a number of times, it only has to go
back over to its home side to reset itself, or it can untag by staying
where it is (N meter radius) for some number of seconds. Or zero speed
for some number of seconds.

NODE_REPORTER must be UNHACKABLE

Goal: One mission file for

- Simulation
- Headless Simulation
- In-water Experiments


o The launch.sh script will launch simulation, with flags supporting
headless simulation. It will invoke launch_vehicle.sh and
launch_shoreside.sh

o The launch_shoreside.sh script is called by launch.sh, but also
is launched directly on the shoreside computer when launched at
the Pavilion or similar in-field station

o The launch_vehicle.sh script
